# Moin!

This app will some day gather all data that is relevant for you, for
all the apps out there. It will provide you a dashboard that shows
you what happened, split up by days. Plus it will run as cron job
every night and send you a nice summary email.

What could be in there?

- Github issues closed / opened on an organization
- new comments on your blog
- new mentions on twitter
- visitors on your website
- users / upgrades / closed accounts of your app
- your events for tomorrow

## Current state

not there yet ;) But it works, and it was only a few hours of work :)

It currently only shows all issues that have been closed at one of
hoodiehq's repositories in the past day.
